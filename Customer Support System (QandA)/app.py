    message e.g. that Laptop X is bigger than \
    Laptop Y, or that Laptop Z has a 2 year warranty.

    # Step 4: providing corrections
    Step 4:{delimiter}: If the user made any assumptions, \
    figure out whether the assumption is true based on your \
    product information. 

    # Step 5
    Step 5:{delimiter}: First, politely correct the \
    customer's incorrect assumptions if applicable. \
    Only mention or reference products in the list of \
    5 available products, as these are the only 5 \
    products that the store sells. \
